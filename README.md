# Cogsy-Challenge

## src/index.js
**Contains the resolution of the challenge**

## src/refactored.js
**Contains the resolution of the challenge refactored using reduce()**

2 solutions are represented:

  - toFlatArrayRecV1() uses reduce() and keeps the same structure as the first resolution in index.js
  - toFlatArrayRecV2() uses reduce() and presents another, more condensed solution

## tests/index.test.js
**Contains the automated tests**

I used the library "Jest" to operate them

__How to run the tests ?__
1. Clone the project
2. run the command `npm install` in the project directory
3. run the command `npm test` in the project directory
